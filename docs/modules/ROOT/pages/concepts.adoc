= Concepts

This chapter deals with various concepts that are applicable for all modules offered.
Especially checkout the page regarding xref:concepts.adoc#concepts_naming-conventions[naming conventions], for all Cypher and Java-based migrations and callbacks.

[[concepts_connectivity]]
== Connectivity

Neo4j-Migrations solely uses the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver].
Most of the time you pass a pre-configured driver object to our API.
The Spring-Boot-Plugin depends on the driver-instance provided by Spring-Boot which can be configured via properties in the `spring.neo4j.*` space.
The CLI and Maven-Plugin offer parameters to define the URL, username and password alike.

All of this mean that we can keep this chapter short and basically defer to the driver's documentation:
https://neo4j.com/docs/java-manual/current/[The Neo4j Java Driver Manual v4.4].
For ease of use, here are the most common forms of URLs the driver might take.
The URLS all have this format: `<NEO4J_PROTOCOL>://<HOST>:<PORT>`.
The Neo4j-Protocol might be one of the following:

[cols="10m,5a,40a",options=header]
|===
|URI scheme
|Routing
|Description

|neo4j
|Yes
|Unsecured

|neo4j+s
|Yes
|Secured with full certificate

|neo4j+ssc
|Yes
|Secured with self-signed certificate

|bolt
|No
|Unsecured

|bolt+s
|No
|Secured with full certificate

|bolt+ssc
|No
|Secured with self-signed certificate
|===

You don't have to care much more about the Driver API than knowing how to create an instance:

.Create an instance of the Neo4j-Java-Driver
[source,java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.AuthTokens;
import org.neo4j.driver.Config;
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.GraphDatabase;

class HowToCreateADriverInstance {

	public static void main(String... args) {
		Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
			"neo4j://your.database.io",
			AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"),
			Config.defaultConfig()
		);
	}
}
----

This instance needs to be passed than to the Neo4j-Migrations Core API in case you aren't using one of our integrations.
Mostly everything else than can be done via Cypher scripts alone.
If you need more control about what happens in a migration, have a look at our xref:concepts.adoc#concepts_migrations_java-based[Java-based migration support].

[[concepts_locations]]
== Locations

You need to store migrations somewhere. Essentially, Neo4j-Migrations offers three categories:

* class- or module-path based packages
* classpath based locations
* file based locations

The former does support Java (and Kotlin) classes, the two latter only supports Cypher (and XML) based scripts, for obvious reasons: Neo4j-Migrations won't pick up external Java files and compile them for you.

Packages are configured through `packagesToScan` in `MigrationConfig`. A corresponding property is available in all framework integrations and in the CLI.

Locations for resources must be configured through `locationsToScan`. Again, a corresponding property is available in all framework integrations and in the CLI. Additionally, the xref:usage.adoc#usage_quarkus[Quarkus integration] offers `externalLocations`. Why? Because `locationsToScan` will be treated by Quarkus as build-time properties and be resolved during built-time, becoming part of the Jar-file or native image. Hence, you wouldn't be able to change them later. `externalLocations` will stay flexible, the semantics however are the same.

=== `classpath:` or `file:` protocol?

Neo4j-Migrations differentiates for the `locationsToScan` option between the `classpath:` and the `file:` protocol with the following syntax and semantics:

`a/b/c`:: Implicitly assuming `classpath:`, treating the value `a/b/c` as the package `a.b.c`.
`/a/b/c`:: Implicitly assuming `classpath:`, treating the value `a/b/c` as the package `a.b.c`, the leading forward-slash is superfluous and will be stripped.
`classpath:a/b/c` respectively `classpath:/a/b/c`:: Same as the above, but explicitly enabling classpath scanning in the given package.
`./whatever/../a/b/c`:: Implicitly assuming `file:`, indicated by the leading dot (`.`), which has the same semantics as in a filesystem. Neo4j-Migrations will resolve the given relative path against the current working directory and look there for a directory structure of `a/b/c`.
`../migrations/a/b/c`:: Implicitly assuming `file:`, indicated by the leading dots (`..`), which have the same semantics as in a filesystem. Neo4j-Migrations will resolve the given relative path against the current working directory and look in its parent directory for a directory structure of `migrations/a/b/c`.
Using the `file:` uri scheme:: This one is a bit tricky, and you might want to read up about it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme[here]. Neo4j-Migrations is strict about the number of forward slashes here: A valid file URI must begin with either `file:/path` (no hostname), `file:///path` (empty hostname), or `file://hostname/path`. Neo4j-Migrations will strip away any hostname, relative paths are not allowed within the `file:` uri scheme and will be stripped away.

Note: Scanning the root package is not supported, as it might become slow and sometimes dangerous, too. In the end, you would not want to bring in a dependency that might contain a Cypher resource that fit the naming conventions of Neo4j-Migrations and truncate your database, would you?

Any configured file-system location that does not exist or isn't a directory will be logged on `WARNING` level.

[[concepts_migrations]]
== Migrations

Migrations are all operations or refactorings you apply to a database.
These operations might be creating, changing, or dropping indexes and constraints or altering data.
Sometimes you might even want to create users or databases.

Cypher (`.cypher`), Catalog-based (`.xml`) and class based (i.e. `.java` or `.kt`) based migrations require a certain naming
convention to be recognized:

[source,console]
----
V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.(cypher|xml|java)
----

* Prefix `V` for "__V__ersioned migration" or `R` for "__R__epeatable migration"
* Version with optional underscores separating as many parts as you like
* Separator: `__` (two underscores)
* Required description: Underscores or spaces might be used to separate words
* Suffix: Depending on the given type.

Exceptions are made for callbacks (see xref:concepts.adoc#concepts_naming-conventions[naming conventions]) and some xref:appendix.adoc[extensions] supported by Neo4j-Migrations.

[[concepts_migrations_cypher-based]]
=== Cypher-based

Cypher-based migrations can be mostly anything you can write down as https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/[Cypher statement].
A Cypher-based migration can contain one or more statements with multiple lines separated by a `;` followed by a new line.
By default, all statements in one script will be executed in a single transaction.

Here's an example:

[source,cypher]
.neo4j/migrations/V007__BondTheNameIsBond.cypher
----
CREATE (agent:`007`) RETURN agent;
UNWIND RANGE(1,6) AS i
WITH i CREATE (n:OtherAgents {idx: '00' + i})
RETURN n
;
----

This script contains two different statements.

Neo4j-Migrations will by default look in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` for all `*.cypher` files matching the name described in
<<concepts_naming-conventions>>. You can change (or add to this default) with the Core API or the appropriate properties in
Spring-Boot-Starter or the Maven-Plugin like this:

.Changing the locations to scan for Migrations (and Callbacks) via the Core API
[source,java]
----
MigrationsConfig configLookingAtDifferentPlaces = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withLocationsToScan(
        "classpath:my/awesome/migrations", // <.>
        "file:/path/to/migration" // <.>
    ).build();
----
<.> Look at a different place on the classpath
<.> Look additional at the given filesystem path

==== Switching database inside Cypher scripts

===== With the command `:USE`

The command `:USE` has the same meaning as in Neo4j-Browser or Cypher-Shell: All following commands will be applied in the given database.
The transaction mode will be applied as configured per database and will "restart" when you switch the database again.
This is the preferred way of doing things like this:

.Switching databases in flight with `:USE`
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE database foo IF NOT EXISTS WAIT;
:use foo;
CREATE (n:InFoo {foo: 'bar'});
:use neo4j;
CREATE (n:InNeo4j);
----

===== With the Cypher keyword `USE`

It is of course possible to use the Cypher keyword `USE <graph>` (See https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/use/[USE]) inside your scripts.
There are a couple of things to remember, though:

* It can get tricky if you combine it in creative ways with the options for schema- and target-databases Neo4j-Migrations offer itself
* If you have more than one statement per script (which is completely not a problem) and one of them should use `USE` you must
configure Neo4j-Migrations to use `TransactionMode#PER_STATEMENT` (see <<concepts_transactions>>, meaning to run each statement of a script in a separate transaction.
This is slightly more error-prone, as it will most likely leave your database in an inconsistent state if one statement fails, since everything
before has already been committed.

[[concepts_migrations_catalog-based]]
=== Based on a catalog

Migrations can be used to define a local catalog in an iterative fashion. Each migration discovered will contribute to a catalog
known in the context of a `Migration` instance.

Catalog based migrations are written in XML and can contain one `<catalog />` item per migration and many `<operation />` items
per migration.

The simplest way of defining a catalog based migrations looks like this:

.V01__Create_unique_isbn.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::{examplesDir}/V01__Create_constraints_local.xml[]
----

Here a unique constraint is defined for the property `isbn` of all nodes labelled `Book`. This constraint is known only locally
and does not contribute to the contextual catalog.

This can also be rewritten such as this:

.V01__Create_unique_isbn.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::{examplesDir}/V01__Create_constraints_global.xml[]
----

The constraint can be reused later, too:

.V23__Drop_old_constraint.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::{examplesDir}/V23__Drop_old_constraint.xml[]
----

Indexes are supported, too:

.V01__Create_an_index_local.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::{examplesDir}/V01__Create_an_index_local.xml[]
----

NOTE: The XML schema supports types for indexes as well: `FULLTEXT` and `TEXT`. The former being the well known
      Lucene backed indexes, the latter the new `TEXT` index introduced in Neo4j.


To learn more about the scheme, have a look at the xref:appendix.adoc#appendix_xml_schemes_migration[XML schema explained] and also make
sure you follow the <<concepts_catalog, concepts about catalogs>> as well as the xref:usage.adoc#usage_defining_asserting_applying_catalogs[catalog examples].

Last but not least, Neo4j-Migrations offers several built-in refactorings, modelled after https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/4.4/overview/apoc.refactor/[APOC Refactor] but without requiring APOC to be installed inside the database or cluster.

The example given in the APOC docs above can be identically modelled with the following catalog item:

.V42__Rename_labels.xml
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::{examplesDir}/V42__Rename_labels.xml[]
----

It will rename the label `Engineer` on all nodes matching the custom query to `DevRel`.

All supported refactorings are described in xref:appendix.adoc#appendix_refactorings[Refactorings].


*What's the advantage of using XML instead of a Cypher-based migration for this purpose?*
The syntax for defining constraints and indexes has been changed considerably over the last decade of Neo4j versions and
many variants that used to be possible in Neo4j 3.5 have been deprecated for a while and will vanish in Neo4j 5.0.

With a neutral representation of constraints and indexes, we can translate these items into the syntax that fits your target
database. In addition, we also can do idempotent operations on older databases that don't actually have them.

Furthermore, some structured form is necessary for creating a representation of concepts like refactorings.

*What's the advantage of using Catalog-based migrations for the purpose of creating constraints and indexes for specific
versions of Neo4j compared to Cypher-based migrations with <<concepts_preconditions,preconditions>>?* When using preconditions
it is up to you to take care of newer versions of Neo4j as they come available as well as making sure you get the syntax right.
Using a Catalog-based migration frees you from this duty. Preconditions have been available earlier than the
<<concepts_catalog,concept of a catalog>> and can be used for many purposes (i.e. making sure actual data exists).
In contrast to that, Catalog-based migrations have a very strong focus on actual schema items.

However, Catalog-based migrations offer support for preconditions too. They can be added as XML processing instructions
anywhere in the document and look like this:

.Example for preconditions as processing instructions
[source,xml,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<migration xmlns="https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations">
	<?assert that edition is enterprise ?>
	<?assume q' RETURN true?>
</migration>
----

They can appear anywhere in the document, but we recommend putting them into the root element.

WARNING: While both elements - `constraint` and `index` - do support a child element named `options`, these are not
         rendered or used yet.

[[concepts_migrations_java-based]]
=== Java-based

Neo4j-Migrations provides the interface `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration` for you to implement.
Based on that interface you can do much more than just migrate things via adding or changing data:
You can refactor everything in your database in a programmatic way.
One possible migration looks like this:

.Example for a Java-based refactoring
[source,java]
----
package some.migrations;

import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration;
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationContext;

import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.Session;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        try (Session session = context.getSession()) { // <1>
            // Steps necessary for a migration
        }
    }
}
----
<.> The `MigrationContext` provides both `getSession()` or `getSessionConfig()` to be used in combination with `getDriver()`.
    The latter is helpful when you want to have access to a reactive or asynchronous session.
    It is important that you use the convenience method `getSession()` or create a session with the provided config as only
    those guarantee that your database session will be connected to the configured target database with the configured user.
    In addition, our context will take care of managing Neo4j causal cluster bookmarks.
    However, if you feel like it is necessary to switch to a different database, you can use the driver instance any way you want.
    The transaction handling inside Java-based migrations is completely up to you.

You don't have to annotate your Java-based migrations in any way.
Neo4j-Migrations will find them on the classpath as is.
The same naming requirements that apply to Cypher scripts apply to Java-based migrations as well, see <<concepts_naming-conventions>>.

NOTE: There are some restrictions when it comes to run Neo4j-Migrations on GraalVM native image:
      You might or might not be able to convince the runtime to find implementations of an interface in native image.
      You must at least explicitly include those classes in the native image unless used otherwise as well.
      +
      The CLI will outright refuse to scan for Java-based migrations in its native form (when using the `--package` option).
      It does support them only in JVM mode.

While you can theoretically extend the public base interface `Migration` too, we don't recommend it.
In fact, on JDK 17 we forbid it.
Please use only `JavaBasedMigration` as the base interface for your programmatic migrations.

[[concepts_callbacks]]
== Callbacks

Callbacks are part of a refactoring or a chain of migration that lives outside the chain of things.
As such these callbacks can be used to make sure certain data, constructs or other preconditions are available or fulfilled before anything else happens.
They also come in handy during integration tests.
You might want to have your migrations as part of the main source tree of your application and
at the same time have in your tests source tree the same folder with a bunch of callbacks that
create test data for example in an `afterMigrate` event.

Callbacks are not considered immutable after they have been invoked and their invocation is not stored in the history graph.
This gives you a hook to add some more volatile things to your refactoring.

The `beforeFirstUse` callback is especially handy in cases in which you want to create the target database before migrations
are applied: It will always be invoked inside the home database of the connected user, so at this point, the target database
does not need to exist yet.

NOTE: Be aware that for this to work you *must* specify both *target* and *schema* database: The schema database must exist
      and cannot be created with a `beforeFirstUse` callback. This due to the fact that migrations will always be run inside
      lock represented by a couple of Nodes.
      +
      An appropriate CLI call would look like this:
      +
      `neo4j-migrations --schema-database neo4j --database canBeCreatedWithCallback apply`
      +
      A corresponding callback would contain:
      +
      `CREATE DATABASE canBeCreatedWithCallback IF NOT EXISTS;`

[[concepts_lifecycle-phases]]
=== Lifecycle phases

The following phases are supported:

beforeFirstUse:: The only phase that only runs once for any given instance of Neo4j-Migrations.
It will run before any other operations are called, when the first connection is opened.
Callbacks in this phase will always be invoked in the schema database and not the target database,
so they won't require the target database to be present.
Also, no user impersonation will be performed.
This can be used to create the target database before any migrations or validations are run.
beforeMigrate:: Before migrating a database.
afterMigrate:: After migrating a database, independent of outcome.
beforeClean:: Before cleaning a database.
afterClean:: After cleaning a database, independent of outcome.
beforeValidate:: Before validating a database.
afterValidate:: After validating a database, independent of outcome.
beforeInfo:: Before getting information about the target database.
afterInfo:: After getting information about the target database.

[[concepts_catalog]]
== Using a catalog of items

Neo4j is schema free or a database with little schema. There are labels for nodes, types for relationships and both can
have properties. Hence, property graph. But there's no "hard" schema determining that all nodes have all the same properties
with the same type.

However, there are concepts to force the existence of properties on entities: Constraints.
Constraints can also enforce uniqueness and keys; they go hand in hand with indexes. Constraints and indexes are what we refer
to in Neo4j-Migrations as schema.

NOTE: Why the heck XML? While XML has been badmouthed for a while now, it has a couple of advantages over JSON and YAML,
      especially in terms of schema: There are many options to validate a given document, Document Type Definition (DTD)
      and XML Schema being two of them. Neo4j-Migrations opted for the latter, it is documented in the xref:appendix.adoc#appendix_xml_schemes_migration[appendix].
      Most of your tooling should be able to load this and validate any migration for you and guide you to what is possible
      and what not.
      +
      Our benefit lies in the fact that XML support comes directly with the JVM, and we don't need to introduce any additional
      dependencies to parse and validate content.

A catalog is also used to represent predefined or built-in xref:appendix.adoc#appendix_refactorings[refactorings], such as renaming all occurrences of types or labels.

=== What is a catalog?

Inside Neo4j-Migrations the concept of a catalog has been introduced. A catalog holds the same type of entities as a schema
and migrations can pick up elements from the catalog to define the final schema.

Items can reside multiple times inside the catalog, identified by their id and the version of the migration in which
they have been defined. This is so that a drop operation for example can refer to the last version of an entity applied
to the schema and not to the latest, in which properties or options might have change.

Refactorings exists as a general concept in a catalog, they don't need to be defined, but just declared as an <<catalog_operations, operation>> to be executed.

==== How is a catalog defined?

The catalog comes in two flavors, the remote and the local catalog. The remote catalog - or in other words the catalog defined by
the databases' schema - is the easier one to understand: It is a read-only view on all items contained in the database schema
that Neo4j-Migrations supports, such as constraints and indexes. It can be retrieved on demand any time.

The local catalog is a bit more complex: It is built in an iterative way when discovering migrations. Catalog-based migrations
are read in versioning order. Items in their `<catalog />` definition are required to have a unique id (name) per migration.
All items are added in a versioned manner to the local catalog. If an item named `a` is defined in both version `n` and `n+x`,
it will be accessible in the catalog in both variants. Thus, Neo4j-Migrations can for example support dropping of unnamed
items and recreating them in a new fashion. The approach of a versioned, local catalog also allows executing advanced operations
like `verify`: The verification of the remote catalog against the local catalog triggered in migration `n+1` can refer to
the local catalog in version `n` (the default) to assert the ground for all following operations, or for the current version
to make sure everything exists in a given point in time without executing further operations.

Last but not least: Sometimes it is required to start fresh in a given migration. For this purpose the catalog element supports
an additional attribute `reset`. Setting this to true in any given migration will cause the catalog to be reset in this version.
Resetting means either being replaced with an empty catalog (`<catalog reset="true" />`) or replaced with the actual content.

[[catalog_operations]]
=== Operations working with a catalog

Operations available to catalog based migrations are

`create`:: Create an item
`drop`:: Drop an item
`verify`:: Verify the locally defined catalog against the remote schema
`apply`:: Drop all supported types from the remote schema and create all elements of the local catalog.
`refactor`:: Execute one of several predefined refactorings

While `create` and `drop` work on single item,  `verify` and `apply` work on the whole, known catalog  in a defined version range.

NOTE: A word on naming: Neo4j-Migrations requires unique names of catalog items across the catalog. In contrast to the
Neo4j database itself, using the name `wurstsalat` for both a constraint and an index is prohibited. Recommended
names in this case would be `wurstsalat_exists` and `wurstsalat_index`.

Both `create` and `drop` operations are idempotent by default.
This behaviour can be changed using `ifNotExists` and `ifExists` attributes with a value of `false`.

Be aware that idempotent does not mean "force", especially in the `create` case. If you want to update / replace an existing
constraint, and you are unsure if it does exist or not, use

[source, xml]
----
<migration xmlns="https://michael-simons.github.io/neo4j-migrations">
    <drop item="a" ifExists="true" />
    <create item="a" />
</migration>
----

The drop operation will ensure that the constraint goes away, and the `create` operation will safely build a new one.

==== Verification (or assertions)

`verify` asserts that all items in the catalog are present in an equivalent or identical form in the database. This is a useful
step inside a migration to make sure things are "as you expect" before applying further migrations. Thus, it can only be
used before running any `create`, `drop` or `apply` commands.

The catalog items that are subject to the verification are by default made up from all prior versions to the migration
in which the `verify` appears. As an example, inside migration `V2.1` a `verify` appears. All catalog items from versions
1.0 upto 2.0 will take part of the assertion. Items defined in 2.1 with the same name won't be asserted, so that you can
assert a given state and then redefine parts of it for example.
This behavior can be changed by using the attribute `latest`, setting it to `true` on the element (`<verify latest="true" />`).
This will take the catalog as defined in *this* version.

==== Applying the whole catalog

`apply` on the other hands drops all items in the current physical schema and creates all items in state of the catalog
at the current version of migration. From the same example as above, everything from 1.0 upto and including 2.1 will be
included, definitions will be identified by their name respectively id.

WARNING: The `apply` operation loads all supported item types from the database, drops them and then creates all items of
         the local catalog. This is a potentially destructive operation as it might drop items you have no replacement for.
         +
         Also be aware that neo4j-migrations will never drop the constraints needed for the locking node to function proper
         (Basically, none of the constraints defined for the label `__Neo4jMigrationsLock`).

`apply` can't be used together with `drop` or `create` in the same migration.

==== Executing refactorings

`refactor` is used to run parameterized predefined refactorings. The `refactor` element can be used after the `verify` operation and before, after or in between `drop` or `create` operations. It will be executed in the order in which it was defined. It cannot be used together with `apply`.
Have a look at the general <<concepts_migrations_catalog-based, catalog example>> or at the xref:appendix.adoc#appendix_refactorings[appendix] for some concrete examples of executing predefined refactorings.

=== Create a catalog from the actual database schema

The API provides `getDatabaseCatalog` and `getLocalCatalog` methods.
The former reads all supported items in the Neo4j schema and creates a catalog view on them, the latter provides access
to the catalog defined by all migrations.

Those methods are used by the CLI to provide the ability to dump the whole database schema as a catalog definition in our
own XML format or as Cypher script targeting a specific Neo4j version.

Last but not least, there's public API `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.catalog.CatalogDiff.between` that can be used to
diff two catalogs and evaluate whether they are identical, equivalent or different to each other.

Refactorings cannot be derived from an existing database.

[[concepts_naming-conventions]]
== Naming conventions

=== Cypher-based resources

All Cypher-based resources (especially migration and callback scripts) require `.cypher` as extension.
The Core API, the Spring-Boot-Starter and the Maven-Plugin will by default search for such Cypher scripts in `classpath:neo4j/migrations`.
The CLI has no default search-location.

[[concepts_naming-conventions_migration_scripts]]
==== Migration scripts

A Cypher script based migration must have a name following the given pattern to be recognized:

[source,console]
----
V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.cypher
----

* Prefix `V` for "__V__ersioned migration" or `R` for "__R__epeatable migration"
* Version with optional underscores separating as many parts as you like
* Separator: `__` (two underscores)
* Required description: Underscores or spaces might be used to separate words
* Suffix: `.cypher`

This applies to both Cypher scripts outside an application (in the file system) and inside an application (as resources).

WARNING: Cypher-based migrations scripts are considered to be immutable once applied.
We compute their checksums and record it inside the schema database.
If you change a Cypher-based migration after it has been applied, any further application will fail.
By marking a migration as repeatable you indicate that it is safe to repeat it whenever its checksum changes.

==== Callback scripts

A Cypher script is recognized as a callback for a given lifecycle if it matches the following pattern:

[source,console]
----
nameOfTheLifecyclePhase.cypher
nameOfTheLifecyclePhase__optional_description.cypher
----

`nameOfTheLifecyclePhase` must match exactly (case-sensitive) the name of one of the supported lifecycle phases (see <<concepts_lifecycle-phases>>),
followed by an optional description and the suffix `.cypher`, separated from the name of the phase by two underscores (`__`).
The description is used to order different callback scripts for the same lifecycle phase.
If you use more than one script in the same lifecycle phase without a description, the order is undefined.

NOTE: Callback scripts are not considered to be immutable and can change between execution.
If you use DDL statements such as `CREATE USER` or `CREATE DATABASE` in them make sure you look for an `IF NOT EXITS`
option in your desired clause so that these statements become idempotent.

=== Catalog-based migrations

Catalog-based migrations (See <<concepts_catalog>>) are XML files based on the `migration.xsd` scheme. As such they require
the extension `.xml` and otherwise follow the same naming conventions as <<concepts_naming-conventions_migration_scripts, Cypher-based resources>>.

=== Java-based migrations

For Java (or actually anything that can be compiled to a valid Java class) based migrations, the same naming conventions apply as for
<<concepts_naming-conventions_migration_scripts, Cypher-based scripts>> apart from the extension.
To stick with the above example, `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.cypher++` becomes `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index++` as simple class name,
or in source form, `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.java++`.

Our recommendation is to use something like this:

[source,java]
----
public class V1_2_3__AddLastNameIndex implements JavaBasedMigration {
    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        // Your thing
    }

    @Override
    public String getSource() {
        return "Add last name index"; // <.>
    }
}
----

[[concepts_chain]]
== Chain of applied migrations

All migrations applied to a target database are stored in the schema database.
The target and the schema database can be the same database.
If you are an enterprise customer managing different databases for different tenants that are however used for the same application,
it makes absolutely sense to use a separate schema database that stores all data related to Neo4j-Migrations.

The subgraph will look like this:

image::chain-of-migrations.png[]

In case you use a schema database for any database with a different name than the default (which is `neo4j`) the nodes
labelled `++__Neo4jMigration++` will have an additional property name `migrationTarget` which contains the target graph.

The chain of applied migrations is stable, and you can of course query it (for example in <<concepts_callbacks,callbacks>>),
but you should not modify it in any way or form.
In case you want to get rid of it, please use the xref:usage.adoc#usage_common_clean[`clean`] operation.

[[concepts_separate-databases]]
== Separate schema databases

Since version 1.1.0 you can use a different database for storing information about migrations.
You need to run a Neo4j 4+ Enterprise Edition.
The command line argument and the property, respectively, is `schema-database` throughout the configuration.
The name given must be a valid Neo4j database name (See https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/manage-databases/configuration/[Administration and configuration]).
The database must exist and the user must have write access to it.

Valid scenarios are:

- Using a schema database for one other database
- Using a schema database for maintaining multiple migrations of different databases
- Using pairs of schema databases and target databases

Neo4j-Migrations will create subgraphs in the schema database identifiable by a `migrationTarget`-property in the `__Neo4jMigration`-nodes.
Neo4j-Migrations will *not* record a `migrationTarget` for the default database (usually `neo4j`),
so that this feature doesn't break compatibility with schemas created before 1.1.0.

TIP: It is usually a good idea to separate management data (like in this case the chain of applied migrations) from you own data,
     whether the latter is created or changed by refactorings itself or by an application). So we recommend to use separated databases when
     you're on enterprise edition.

[[concepts_transactions]]
== Transactions

All operations that are managed by Neo4j-Migrations directly, except catalog-based migrations, are executed
inside transactional functions. This is essentially a scope around one or more statements which will be retried on
certain conditions (for example, on losing connectivity inside a cluster setup).

You can configure if all statements of one <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based,Cypher-based>> migration go into one
transactional function or if each statement goes into its own transactional scope:

.Choose transaction behaviour
[source,java]
----
MigrationsConfig configPerMigration = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_MIGRATION)
    .build();

// OR

MigrationsConfig configPerStatement = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_STATEMENT)
    .build();
----

Per Migration is the default, as we think it's safer:
Either the whole migration is applied (or failed) or none.
But there are certain scenarios that require a transaction per statement, for example most DDL operations such as creating
databases might not be run together with DML operations in the same transaction.

WARNING: <<concepts_catalog, Catalog-based migrations>> - that is creation of indexes and constraints through the dedicated
         Neo4j-Migrations API - are always executed inside auto-commit transactions, as the underlying connectivity has some
         deficiencies that don't allow retries or continuing using a transaction in some failure conditions that might happen
         during the creation of schema items.

[[concepts_preconditions]]
== Preconditions

Our <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based,Cypher based migrations>> support a set of simple assertions and assumptions as preconditions
prior to execution.

Preconditions can be added as a single-line Cypher comment to a script. Multiple preconditions in one script must all be
met (logically chained with `AND`).

Assertions::
Preconditions starting with `// assert` are hard requirements. If they cannot be satisfied by the target database, Neo4j-Migrations
will abort.

Assumptions::
Preconditions starting with `// assume` are soft requirements. If they cannot be satisfied, the corresponding script will be skipped
and not be part of any chain.

[[multiple-assumptions]]
WARNING: If you think that preconditions might change (for example when asking for a specific version):
Make sure you have alternative scripts with the same filename available, both having preconditions meeting
the matching cases. We will treat them as alternatives and make sure that a changed checksum is not treated as
an error. For example this would happen if you suddenly one migration has its precondition met which it didn't
before and therefore changing the chain of applied migrations.

=== Require a certain edition

The Neo4j edition can be required with either

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that edition is enterprise
----

or

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that edition is community.
----

=== Require a certain version

The Neo4j version can be required with

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that version is 4.3
----

Multiple versions can be enumerated after the `is` separated by a `,`.

Version ranges can be required with `lt` (lower than) or `ge` (greater than or equals), for example:

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that version is ge 4.0
----

Both assumptions combined makes it safe to use version assumptions (see <<multiple-assumptions, the warning above>>).
We recommend using one refactoring for the minimum version you support and one for all higher that support the feature you
want. For example: Your minimum supported database version is 4.3 and you want to create an existential constraint.
You want to have 2 migrations:

[source,cypher]
.43/V0001__Create_existence_constraint.cypher
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assume that version is 4.3
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS ON (book:Library) ASSERT exists(book.isbn);
----

And the different one for 4.4 or higher:

[source,cypher]
.44/V0001__Create_existence_constraint.cypher
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assume that version is ge 4.4
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (book:Library) REQUIRE book.isbn IS NOT NULL;
----

The former will only applied to the 4.3, the latter to 4.4 or higher. If your user upgrades their
database at some point, Neo4j-Migrations will recognize that it used an older, compatible script
with it and wont fail, even though the new script has a different checksum.

=== Preconditions based on Cypher queries

You can require a precondition based on a query that must return a single, `boolean` value via

[source,cypher]
----
// assume q' RETURN true
----

The above case will of course always be satisfied.

Here's a complete example:

[source,cypher]
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assert that version is 4.4
// assume q' MATCH (book:Library) RETURN count(book) = 0
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (book:Library) REQUIRE book.isbn IS NOT NULL;
----

This refactoring will only execute on Neo4j 4.4 enterprise (due to the requirements of existence constraints and the 4.4 syntax being used)
and will be ignored when there are already nodes labeled `Library`.

=== Why only preconditions for scripts?

Since we offer <<concepts_migrations_java-based,full programmatic access>> to migrations
together with the context that has information about the Neo4j version, edition and access to both target and schema database,
it would be duplicate work if we take the decision away from you. You are completely free inside a programmatic refactoring
not to do anything in a given context. The migration will be dutifully recorded nevertheless.

=== Upgrading older database

Given that your application needs to support multiple versions of Neo4j, including versions that didn't exist when you created
your application originally and you might have invalid Cypher now in potentially already applied migrations you can do the following

* Create sub-folders in your migration locations or configure additional locations
* Duplicate the migrations that contain Cypher that is problematic in newer Neo4j versions
* Keep the names of the migrations identical and distribute them accordingly in these folders
* Add a precondition matching only older versions of Neo4j to one and keep the rest unaltered
* Adapt the other one containing only "good" syntax and add a precondition for the newer Neo4j version

Thus, you support the following scenarios:

* On older database versions against which your application already ran, nothing will change; the migration with the fixed syntax will be skipped
* Same for a clean slate on older database versions
* On the newer database version, only the fixed syntax migration will be applied.

[[concepts_repairing_broken_chains]]
== Repairing migrations

Sometimes things will break, either on purpose or by accident. When a migration chain is broken, it will fail to validate. This can happen for various reasons:

* You change a Cypher script file after it has been applied and its application has been successfully recorded
* You migrate your database as part of your application startup and not with a CI process and used different versions of your application with a different set of migration scripts and classes
* You delete individual script files or classes

In all those cases, the chain of applied migrations won't validate with the current set of migrations discovered. Apart from using the xref:usage.adoc#usage_common_clean[`clean` operation] which would remove the whole chain from your database inevitably leading to all migrations to be re-applied, you have several options to repair your database:

* Delete the offending migrations - those are all for which no script or class can be resolved anymore - individually from the database with the xref:usage.adoc#usage_common_delete[`delete` operation].
* Use the xref:usage.adoc#usage_common_repair[`repair` operation]

The `repair` operation behaves as follows:

* Check all the checksums (pairwise by migration version) and fix the recorded chain if necessary
* Check for missing local migrations and delete the missing ones in the database
* Check for inserted local migrations and create new chain entries with current time stamp

Especially the second step has consequences: If there aren't any local migrations all recorded migrations would be deleted. As misconfigurations can happen (for example during a typo in a path), the `repair` operation will abort if it doesn't find any local migrations. If you want to clean up the database, use the xref:usage.adoc#usage_common_clean[`clean` operation] explicitly.

IMPORTANT: The `repair` operation will *never* apply any migration. Everything it does is fixing the chain of recorded application. Basically it pretends that everything that has been discovered locally has been applied to the database so that you can start on a clean slate.

As the `repair` command won't apply migrations itself, it will stop after the last applied migration. An example: You have 3 local migrations, v1*, v3 and v4. The chain recorded however is  `(v1) -> (v2) -> (v3)`. This means, v1 has changed, it's checksum doesn't match, v2 has been deleted and v4 is new. The repair command will now fix the checksum, delete v2 and then stop, so that the chain now is this: `(v1*) -> (v3)`. v4 can be applied now with the standard `apply` operation.

=== Example

Given the following scenario:
