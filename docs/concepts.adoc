= Concepts

This chapter deals with various concepts that are applicable for all modules offered.
Especially checkout <<concepts_naming-conventions>> regarding naming conventions, for all Cypher and Java-based migrations and callbacks.

[[concepts_connectivity]]
== Connectivity

Neo4j-Migrations solely uses the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver].
Most of the time you pass a pre-configured driver object to our API.
The Spring-Boot-Plugin depends on the driver-instance provided by Spring-Boot which can be configured via properties in the `spring.neo4j.*` space.
The CLI and Maven-Plugin offer parameters to define the URL, username and password alike.

All of this mean that we can keep this chapter short and basically defer to the driver's documentation:
https://neo4j.com/docs/java-manual/current/[The Neo4j Java Driver Manual v4.4].
For ease of use, here are the most common forms of URLs the driver might take.
The URLS all have this format: `<NEO4J_PROTOCOL>://<HOST>:<PORT>`.
The Neo4j-Protocol might be one of the following:

[cols="10m,5a,40a",options=header]
|===
|URI scheme
|Routing
|Description

|neo4j
|Yes
|Unsecured

|neo4j+s
|Yes
|Secured with full certificate

|neo4j+ssc
|Yes
|Secured with self-signed certificate

|bolt
|No
|Unsecured

|bolt+s
|No
|Secured with full certificate

|bolt+ssc
|No
|Secured with self-signed certificate
|===

You don't have to care much more about the Driver API than knowing how to create an instance:

.Create an instance of the Neo4j-Java-Driver
[source,java]
----
import org.neo4j.driver.AuthTokens;
import org.neo4j.driver.Config;
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.GraphDatabase;

class HowToCreateADriverInstance {

	public static void main(String... args) {
		Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver(
			"neo4j://your.database.io",
			AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"),
			Config.defaultConfig()
		);
	}
}
----

This instance needs to be passed than to the Neo4j-Migrations Core API in case you aren't using one of our integrations.
Mostly everything else than can be done via Cypher scripts alone.
If you need more control about what happens in a migration, have a look at our Java-based migration support in <<concepts_migrations_java-based>>.

[[concepts_migrations]]
== Migrations

Migrations are all operations or refactorings you apply to a database.
These operations might be creating, changing, or dropping indexes and constraints or altering data.
Sometimes you might even want to create users or databases.

[[concepts_migrations_cypher-based]]
=== Cypher-based

Cypher-based migrations can be mostly anything you can write down as https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/current/[Cypher statement].
A Cypher-based migration can contain one or more statements with multiple lines separated by a `;` followed by a new line.
By default, all statements in one script will be executed in a single transaction.

Here's an example:

[source,cypher]
.neo4j/migrations/V007__BondTheNameIsBond.cypher
----
CREATE (agent:`007`) RETURN agent;
UNWIND RANGE(1,6) AS i
WITH i CREATE (n:OtherAgents {idx: '00' + i})
RETURN n
;
----

This script contains two different statements.

Neo4j-Migrations will by default look in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` for all `*.cypher` files matching the name described in
<<concepts_naming-conventions>>. You can change (or add to this default) with the Core API or the appropriate properties in
Spring-Boot-Starter or the Maven-Plugin like this:

.Changing the locations to scan for Migrations (and Callbacks) via the Core API
[source,java]
----
MigrationsConfig configLookingAtDifferentPlaces = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withLocationsToScan(
        "classpath:my/awesome/migrations", // <.>
        "file:/path/to/migration" // <.>
    ).build();
----
<.> Look at a different place on the classpath
<.> Look additional at the given filesystem path

==== Switching database inside Cypher scripts

It is of course possible to use the Cypher keyword `USE <graph>` (See https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/use/[USE]) inside your scripts.
There a couple of thinks to remember, though:

* It can get tricky if you combine it in creative ways with the options for schema- and target-databases Neo4j-Migrations offer itself
* If you have more than one statement per script (which is completely not a problem) and one of them should use `USE` you must
configure Neo4j-Migrations to use `TransactionMode#PER_STATEMENT` (see <<concepts_transactions>>, meaning to run each statement of a script in a separate transaction.
This is slightly more error-prone, as it will most likely leave your database in an inconsistent state if one statement fails, since everything
before has already been committed.

[[concepts_migrations_java-based]]
=== Java-based

Neo4j-Migrations provides the interface `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration` for you to implement.
Based on that interface you can do much more than just migrate things via adding or changing data:
You can refactor everything in your database in a programmatic way.
One possible migration looks like this:

.Example for a Java-based refactoring
[source,java]
----
package some.migrations;

import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration;
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationContext;

import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.Session;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        try (Session session = context.getSession()) { // <1>
            // Steps necessary for a migration
        }
    }
}
----
<.> The `MigrationContext` provides both `getSession()` or `getSessionConfig()` to be used in combination with `getDriver()`.
    The latter is helpful when you want to have access to a reactive or asynchronous session.
    It is important that you use the convenient method `getSession()` or create a session with the provided config as only
    those guarantee hat your database session will be connected to the configured target database with the configured user.
    In addition, our context will take care of managing Neo4j causal cluster bookmarks.
    However, if you feel like it is necessary to switch to a different database, you can use the driver instance any way you want.
    The transaction handling inside Java-based migrations is completely up to you.

You don't have to annotate your Java-based migrations in any way.
Neo4j-Migrations will find them on the classpath as is.
The same naming requirements that apply to Cypher scripts apply to Java-based migrations as well, see <<concepts_naming-conventions>>.

NOTE: There are some restrictions when it comes to run Neo4j-Migrations on GraalVM native image:
      You might or might not be able to convince the runtime to find implementations of an interface in native image.
      You must at least explicitly include those classes in the native image unless used otherwise as well.
      +
      The CLI will outright refuse to scan for Java-based migrations in its native form (when using the `--package` option).
      It does support them only in JVM mode.

While you can theoretically extend the public base interface `Migration` too, we don't recommend it.
In fact, on JDK 17 we forbid it.
Please use only `JavaBasedMigration` as the base interface for your programmatic migrations.

[[concepts_preconditions]]
== Preconditions

Our <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based,Cypher based migrations>> support a set of simple assertions and assumptions as preconditions
prior to execution.

Preconditions can be added as a single-line Cypher comment to a script. Multiple preconditions in one script must all be
met (logically chained with `AND`).

Assertions::
Preconditions starting with `// assert` are hard requirements. If they cannot be satisfied by the target database, Neo4j-Migrations
will abort.

Assumptions::
Preconditions starting with `// assume` are soft requirements. If they cannot be satisfied, the corresponding script will be skipped
and not be part of any chain.

[[multiple-assumptions]]
WARNING: If you think that preconditions might change (for example when asking for a specific version):
         Make sure you have alternative scripts with the same filename available, both having preconditions meeting
         the matching cases. We will treat them as alternatives and make sure that a changed checksum is not treated as
         an error. For example this would happen if you suddenly one migration has its precondition met which it didn't
         before and therefore changing the chain of applied migrations.

=== Require a certain edition

The Neo4j edition can be required with either

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that edition is enterprise
----

or

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that edition is community.
----

=== Require a certain version

The Neo4j version can be required with

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that version is 4.3
----

Multiple versions can be enumerated after the `is` separated by a `,`.

Version ranges can be required with `lt` (lower than) or `ge` (greater than or equals), for example:

[source,cypher]
----
// assume that version is ge 4.0
----

Both assumptions combined makes it safe to use version assumptions (see <<multiple-assumptions, the warning above>>).
We recommend using one refactoring for the minimum version you support and one for all higher that support the feature you
want. For example: Your minimum supported database version is 4.3 and you want to create an existential constraint.
You want to have 2 migrations:

[source,cypher]
.43/V0001__Create_existence_constraint.cypher
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assume that version is 4.3
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS ON (book:Library) ASSERT exists(book.isbn);
----

And the different one for 4.4 or higher:

[source,cypher]
.44/V0001__Create_existence_constraint.cypher
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assume that version is ge 4.4
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (book:Library) REQUIRE book.isbn IS NOT NULL;
----

The former will only applied to the 4.3, the latter to 4.4 or higher. If your user upgrades their
database at some point, Neo4j-Migrations will recognize that it used an older, compatible script
with it and wont fail, even though the new script has a different checksum.

=== Preconditions based on Cypher queries

You can require a precondition based on a query that must return a single, `boolean` value via

[source,cypher]
----
// assume q' RETURN true
----

The above case will of course always be satisfied.

Here's a complete example:

[source,cypher]
----
// assert that edition is enterprise
// assert that version is 4.4
// assume q' MATCH (book:Library) RETURN count(book) = 0
CREATE CONSTRAINT isbn_exists IF NOT EXISTS FOR (book:Library) REQUIRE book.isbn IS NOT NULL;
----

This refactoring will only execute on Neo4j 4.4 enterprise (due to the requirements of existence constraints and the 4.4 syntax being used)
and will be ignored when there are already nodes labeled `Library`.


=== Why only preconditions for scripts?

Since we offer <<concepts_migrations_java-based,full programmatic access>> to migrations
together with the context that has information about the Neo4j version, edition and access to both target and schema database,
it would be duplicate work if we take the decision away from you. You are completely free inside a programmatic refactoring
not to do anything in a given context. The migration will be dutifully recorded nevertheless.

[[concepts_callbacks]]
== Callbacks

Callbacks are part of a refactoring or a chain of migration that lives outside the chain of things.
As such these callbacks can be used to make sure certain data, constructs or other preconditions are available or fulfilled before anything else happens.
They also come in handy during integration tests.
You might want to have your migrations as part of the main source tree of your application and
at the same time have in your tests source tree the same folder with a bunch of callbacks that
create test data for example in an `afterMigrate` event.

Callbacks are not considered immutable after they have been invoked and their invocation is not stored in the history graph.
This gives you a hook to add some more volatile things to your refactoring.

The `beforeFirstUse` callback is especially handy in cases in which you want to create the target database before migrations
are applied: It will always be invoked inside the home database of the connected user, so at this point, the target database
does not need to exist yet.

[[concepts_lifecycle-phases]]
=== Lifecycle phases

The following phases are supported:

beforeFirstUse:: The only phase that only runs once for any given instance of Neo4j-Migrations.
It will run before any other operations are called, when the first connection is opened.
Callbacks in this phase will always be invoked in the schema database and not the target database,
so they won't require the target database to be present.
Also, no user impersonation will be performed.
This can be used to create the target database before any migrations or validations are run.
beforeMigrate:: Before migrating a database.
afterMigrate:: After migrating a database, independent of outcome.
beforeClean:: Before cleaning a database.
afterClean:: After cleaning a database, independent of outcome.
beforeValidate:: Before validating a database.
afterValidate:: After validating a database, independent of outcome.
beforeInfo:: Before getting information about the target database.
afterInfo:: After getting information about the target database.

[[concepts_naming-conventions]]
== Naming conventions

=== Cypher-based resources

All Cypher-based resources (especially migration and callback scripts) require `.cypher` as extension.
The Core API, the Spring-Boot-Starter and the Maven-Plugin will by default search for such Cypher scripts in `classpath:neo4j/migrations`.
The CLI has no default search-location.

[[concepts_naming-conventions_migration_scripts]]
==== Migration scripts

A Cypher script based migration must have a name following the given pattern to be recognized:

[source,console]
----
V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.cypher
----

* Prefix `V` for "__V__ersioned Migrations"
* Version with optional underscores separating as many parts as you like
* Separator: `__` (two underscores)
* Required description: Underscores or spaces might be used to separate words
* Suffix: `.cypher`

This applies to both Cypher scripts outside an application (in the file system) and inside an application (as resources).

WARNING: Cypher-based migrations scripts are considered to be immutable once applied!
We compute their checksums and record it inside the schema database.
If you change a Cypher-based migration after it has been applied, any further application will fail.

==== Callback scripts

A Cypher script is recognized as a callback for a given lifecycle if it matches the following pattern:

[source,console]
----
nameOfTheLifecyclePhase.cypher
nameOfTheLifecyclePhase__optional_description.cypher
----

`nameOfTheLifecyclePhase` must match exactly (case-sensitive) the name of one of the supported lifecycle phases (see <<concepts_lifecycle-phases>>),
followed by an optional description and the suffix `.cypher`, separated from the name of the phase by two underscores (`__`).
The description is used to order different callback scripts for the same lifecycle phase.
If you use more than one script in the same lifecycle phase without a description, the order is undefined.

NOTE: Callback scripts are not considered to be immutable and can change between execution.
If you use DDL statements such as `CREATE USER` or `CREATE DATABASE` in them make sure you look for an `IF NOT EXITS`
option in your desired clause so that these statements become idempotent.

=== Java-based migrations

For Java (or actually anything that can be compiled to a valid Java class) based migrations, the same naming conventions apply as for
<<concepts_naming-conventions_migration_scripts, Cypher-based scripts>> apart from the extension.
To stick with the above example, `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.cypher++` becomes `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index++` as simple class name,
or in source form, `++V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.java++`.

Our recommendation is to use something like this:

[source,java]
----
public class V1_2_3__AddLastNameIndex implements JavaBasedMigration {
    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        // Your thing
    }

    @Override
    public String getSource() {
        return "Add last name index"; // <.>
    }
}
----
<.> Defaults to the simple class name being added to the history chain.

[[concepts_chain]]
== Chain of applied migrations

All migrations applied to a target database are stored in the schema database.
The target and the schema database can be the same database.
If you are an enterprise customer managing different databases for different tenants that are however used for the same application,
it makes absolutely sense to use a separate schema database that stores all data related to Neo4j-Migrations.

The subgraph will look like this:

image::chain-of-migrations.png[]

In case you use a schema database for any database with a different name than the default (which is `neo4j`) the nodes
labelled `++__Neo4jMigration++` will have an additional property name `migrationTarget` which contains the target graph.

The chain of applied migrations is stable, and you can of course query it (for example in <<concepts_callbacks,callbacks>>),
but you should not modify it in any way or form.
In case you want to get rid of it, please use the <<usage_common_clean,`clean`>> operation.

[[concepts_separate-databases]]
== Separate schema databases

Since version 1.1.0 you can use a different database for storing information about migrations.
You need to run a Neo4j 4+ Enterprise Edition.
The command line argument and the property, respectively, is `schema-database` throughout the configuration.
The name given must be a valid Neo4j database name (See https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/manage-databases/configuration/[Administration and configuration]).
The database must exist and the user must have write access to it.

Valid scenarios are:

- Using a schema database for one other database
- Using a schema database for maintaining multiple migrations of different databases
- Using pairs of schema databases and target databases

Neo4j-Migrations will create subgraphs in the schema database identifiable by a `migrationTarget`-property in the `__Neo4jMigration`-nodes.
Neo4j-Migrations will *not* record a `migrationTarget` for the default database (usually `neo4j`),
so that this feature doesn't break compatibility with schemas created before 1.1.0.

[[concepts_transactions]]
== Transactions

All operations executed directly by Neo4j-Migrations are executed inside transactional functions.
This is essentially a scope around one or more statements which will be retried on certain conditions (for example, on losing connectivity inside a cluster setup).

You can configure if all statements of one <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based,Cypher-based>> migration go into one
transactional function or if each statement goes into its own transactional scope:

.Choose transaction behaviour
[source,java]
----
MigrationsConfig configPerMigration = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_MIGRATION)
    .build();

// OR

MigrationsConfig configPerStatement = MigrationsConfig.builder()
    .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_STATEMENT)
    .build();
----

Per Migration is the default, as we think it's safer:
Either the whole migration is applied (or failed) or none.
But there are certain scenarios that require a transaction per statement, for example most DDL operations such as creating
databases might not be run together with DML operations in the same transaction.
