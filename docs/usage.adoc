= Usage

[[usage_common]]
== Common operations

[[usage_common_clean]]
=== Clean

`clean` applies by default to the schema database.
It will remove Neo4j-Migrations related nodes and relationships.
If there is no schema database selected, it works on the optional target database.
If this isn't configured either, the users home database will be used.

The clean operation will search for

* Migration chains (those are the nodes containing information about the applied migrations)
* Any log from this Neo4j-Migrations
* Any constraints created by Neo4j-Migrations

and will delete and drop them in that order.
This is a *destructive* operation, so make sure not to apply it to your production database without thinking at least twice.
It cannot be undone via Neo4j-Migrations.

The operation takes in a boolean parameter.
When set to `false`, only the <<concepts_chain,migration chain>> for the currently configured target database will be deleted.
When set to `true`, all objects created by Neo4j-Migrations will be deleted.

[[usage_common_info]]
=== Info

The `info` operations returns information about the context, the database, all applied and all pending applications.

[[usage_common_migrate]]
=== Migrate / apply

The `migrate` command (or its underlying method `apply` in the Migrations Core API) does exactly that:
It applies all locally resolved migrations to the target database and stores the <<concepts_chain,chain of applied migrations>> in the schema database.

It returns the last applied version.

[[usage_common_validate]]
=== Validate

The `validate` operations resolves all local migrations and checks whether all have applied in the same order and in the
same version to the configured database.
A target database will validate as valid when all migrations have been applied in the right order and invalid in any cases
where migrations are missing, have not been applied, applied in a different order or with a different checksum.

The validation result provides an additional operation `needsRepair()`.
In case the result is invalid you might check if it needs repair.
If not, you can just call the <<usage_common_migrate, apply operation>> to turn the database into a valid state.

== CLI

Please choose the version of Neo4j-Migrations-CLI fitting your operating system or target system as described in <<download_cli>>.
In the following we assume you downloaded and unzipped the architecture independent version.
For that version to work, you need to have JDK 8 or higher installed:

.Download and extraction of the JVM based version
[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
java -version
curl -LO https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
unzip neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}
./bin/neo4j-migrations -V
----

Those commands should first print out your Java version, then download, extract and run Neo4j-Migrations-CLI to give you its version.

TIP: If you only deal with <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based, Cypher-based migrations>> and
      don't have the need for any <<concepts_migrations_java-based,programmatic migrations>>,
      we provide a native binary for your platform, make sure to choose that.
      Its startup time is faster, and you don't need to have a JVM installed.

=== All options and arguments

The CLI comes with a build-in help, accessible via `neo4j-migrations -h` or `neo4j-migrations --help`:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./bin/neo4j-migrations --help
Usage: neo4j-migrations [-hvV] [--autocrlf] [--validate-on-migrate] -p
                        [=<password>] [-p[=<password>]]... [-a=<address>]

                        [--location=<locationsToScan>]...
                        [--package=<packagesToScan>]... [COMMAND]
Migrates Neo4j databases.
  -a, --address=<address>   The address this migration should connect to. The
                              driver supports bolt, bolt+routing or neo4j as
                              schemes.
      --autocrlf            Automatically convert Windows line-endings (CRLF)
                              to LF when reading resource based migrations,
                              pretty much what the same Git option does during
                              checkin.
  -d, --database=<database> The database that should be migrated (Neo4j EE 4.0
                              +).
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
      --impersonate=<impersonatedUser>
                            The name of a user to impersonate during migration
                              (Neo4j EE 4.4+).
      --location=<locationsToScan>
                            Location to scan. Repeat for multiple locations.
  -p, --password[=<password>]
                            The password of the user connecting to the database.
      --package=<packagesToScan>
                            Package to scan. Repeat for multiple packages.
      --schema-database=<schemaDatabase>
                            The database that should be used for storing
                              information about migrations (Neo4j EE 4.0+).
      --transaction-mode=<transactionMode>
                            The transaction mode to use.
  -u, --username=<user>     The login of the user connecting to the database.
  -v                        Log the configuration and a couple of other things.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
      --validate-on-migrate Validating helps you verify that the migrations
                              applied to the database match the ones available
                              locally and is on by default.
Commands:
  clean     Removes Neo4j-Migration specific data from the selected schema
              database
  help      Displays help information about the specified command
  info      Retrieves all applied and pending informations, prints them and
              exits.
  migrate   Retrieves all pending migrations, verify and applies them.
  validate  Resolves all local migrations and validates the state of the
              configured database with them.

=== Safe passwords in CI/CD usage

There are 4 ways to specify the password:

. interactive: Use `--password` without arguments and your shell will prompt you with a hidden prompt.
. direct: Use `--password not-so-secret`. The password will be visible in the shell history and in the process monitor.
. Via environment variable: Define an environment variable like `MY_PASSWORD` and use `--password:env MY_PASSWORD`. Note
  that the parameter is the *name*  of the variable, not the resolved value.
. Via a file: Create a file in a safe space and add your password in a single line in that file and use `--password:file path/to/your/passwordFile`.
  The password will be read from this file.

The last two options are a safe choice in scripts or in a CI/CD environment.

=== Enable autocompletion for Neo4j-Migrations in your shell

Neo4j-Migrations can generate a shell script providing autocompletion for its options in Bash, zsh and others.
Here's how to use it:

.Generate autocompletion script
[source,console]
----
./bin/neo4j-migrations generate-completion > neo4j-migrations_completion.sh
----

The generated script `neo4j-migrations_completion.sh` can than be run via `. neo4j-migrations_completion.sh` or permanently installed by
sourcing it in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

If you want to have autocompletion for Neo4j-Migrations just in your current shell use the following command

.Add autocompletion to your current shell
[source,console]
----
source <(./bin/neo4j-migrations generate-completion)
----

NOTE: Autocompletion for macOS is automatically installed when you use <<download_cli_brew,Homebrew>>.

=== Full example

Here's an example that looks for migrations in a Java package, its subpackages and in a filesystem location for Cypher-based migrations.
In this example we have exported the directory with our Java-based migrations like this: `export CLASSPATH_PREFIX=~/Projects/neo4j-migrations/neo4j-migrations-core/target/test-classes/`.
Please adapt accordingly to your project and / or needs.

The example uses the `info` command to tell you which migrations have been applied and which not:

You can repeat both `--package`  and `--location` parameter for fine-grained control.
Use `migrate` to apply migrations:

=== A template for Java-based migrations

As stated above, this will work only with the JVM distribution.
Follow those steps:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
wget https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
unzip neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}
mkdir -p my-migrations/some/migrations
cat <<EOT >> my-migrations/some/migrations/V001__MyFirstMigration.java
package some.migrations;

import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration;
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationContext;

import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.Session;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        try (Session session = context.getSession()) {
        }
    }
}
EOT
javac -cp "lib/*" my-migrations/some/migrations/*
CLASSPATH_PREFIX=my-migrations ./bin/neo4j-migrations -v -uneo4j -psecret --package some.migrations info
----

NOTE: We do add this here for completeness, but we do think that Java-based migrations makes most sense from inside your application,
      regardless whether it's a Spring Boot, Quarkus or just a plain Java application.
      The CLI should be seen primarily as a script runner.

== Core API

We publish the Java-API-Docs here: link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations/apidocs/index.html[Neo4j Migrations (Core) {latest_version} API].
Follow the instructions for your favorite dependency management tool to get hold of the core API as described in <<download_core>>.

The classes you will be working with are `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationsConfig` and its related builder and
`ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.Migrations` and maybe `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration` in case you
want to do programmatic refactorings.

=== Configuration and usage

Configuration is basically made up of two parts:
Creating a driver instance that points to your database or cluster as described in <<concepts_connectivity>> and an instance of `MigrationsConfig`.
An instance of `MigrationsConfig` is created via a fluent-builder API.
Putting everything together looks like this:

.Creating an instance of `Migrations` based on a configuration object and the Java driver
[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations = new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder()
        .withPackagesToScan("some.migrations")
        .withLocationsToScan(
            "classpath:my/awesome/migrations",
            "file:/path/to/migration"
        )
        .build(),
    GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"))
);

migrations.apply(); // <.>
----
<.> Applies this migration object and migrates the database

In case anything goes wrong the API will throw a `ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationsException`.
Of course your migrations will be recorded as a chain of applied migrations (as nodes with the label `++__Neo4jMigration++`) as well when you use the API directly.

=== Running on the Java module-path

Neo4j-Migrations can be used on the Java module path. Make sure you require them in your module and export packages with Java-based migrations in case you're using the latter.
Resoruces on the classpath should be picked up automatically:

.Using Neo4j-Migrations on the module path
[source,java]
----
module my.module {
    requires ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core;

    exports my.module.java_based_migrations; // <.>
}
----
<.> Only needed when you actually have those

[[usage_spring-boot-starter]]
== Spring-Boot-Starter

We provide a starter with automatic configuration for https://start.spring.io[Spring Boot].
Declare the following dependency in your Spring Boot application:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifactIdSpringBoot}</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Or follow the instructions for Gradle in <<download_springboot>>.

That starter itself depends on the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver].
The driver is managed by Spring Boot since 2.4, and you can enjoy configuration support directly through Spring Boot.
For Spring Boot versions prior to Spring Boot 2.4, please have a look at version https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/tree/0.0.13[0.0.13] of this library.

Neo4j-Migrations will automatically look for migrations in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` and will fail if this location does not exist.
It does not scan by default for Java-based migrations.

Here's an example on how to configure the driver and the migrations:

.Configure both the driver, disable the existence check for migration scripts and scan for Java-based migration
[source,properties]
----
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=secret
spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687

# Add configuration for your migrations, for example, additional packages to scan
org.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan=your.changesets, another.changeset

# Or disable the check if the location exists
org.neo4j.migrations.check-location=false
----

Have a look at <<usage_spring-boot_all-properties>> for all supported properties.

=== Usage with `@DataNeo4jTest`

If you want to use your migrations together with `@DataNeo4jTest` which is provided with Spring Boot out of the box,
you have to manually import our autoconfiguration like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.MigrationsAutoConfiguration;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.ImportAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.data.neo4j.DataNeo4jTest;

import org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertyRegistry;
import org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertySource;
import org.testcontainers.containers.Neo4jContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Testcontainers;
import org.testcontainers.utility.TestcontainersConfiguration;

@Testcontainers(disabledWithoutDocker = true)
@DataNeo4jTest // <.>
@ImportAutoConfiguration(MigrationsAutoConfiguration.class) // <.>
public class UsingDataNeo4jTest {

	@Container
	private static Neo4jContainer<?> neo4j = new Neo4jContainer<>("neo4j:4.2")
		.withReuse(TestcontainersConfiguration.getInstance().environmentSupportsReuse()); // <.>

	@DynamicPropertySource
	static void neo4jProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) { // <.>

		registry.add("spring.neo4j.uri", neo4j::getBoltUrl);
		registry.add("spring.neo4j.authentication.username", () -> "neo4j");
		registry.add("spring.neo4j.authentication.password", neo4j::getAdminPassword);
	}

	@Test
	void yourTest(@Autowired Driver driver) {
		// Whatever is tested
    }
}
----
<.> Use the dedicated Neo4j test slice
<.> Import _this_ auto-configuration (which is not part of Spring Boot)
<.> Bring up a container to test against
<.> Use `DynamicPropertySource`  for configuring the test resources dynamically

[[usage_spring-boot_all-properties]]

| java.lang.Boolean
| true
| Whether to enable Neo4j-Migrations or not.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.encoding`
| java.nio.charset.Charset
| UTF-8
| Encoding of Cypher migrations.

[[usage_quarkus]]
== Quarkus

We provide a module with automatic configuration for Quarkus.
Declare the following dependency in your Quarkus application:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifactIdQuarkus}</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

That module itself depends on the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver] and the corresponding
Quarkus extension https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-neo4j[Quarkus-Neo4j] and requires at least Quarkus 2.6.
You don't need to declare those dependencies, this module will do for your.

Neo4j-Migrations will automatically look for migrations in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` and will fail if this location does not exist.
It does not scan by default for Java-based migrations.

Here's an example on how to configure the driver and the migrations:

.Configure both the driver and scan for Java-based migrations, too
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
quarkus.neo4j.authentication.password=secret

quarkus.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan=foo.bar
----

WARNING: The extension will not find Cypher-based migrations when the Quarkus application is packaged up as
         GraalVM native image. If you want to deploy your application as native image, you must store Cypher-based
         migrations external to this application and use `quarkus.neo4j.migrations.locations-to-scan=file://path/to/your/migraitons`.

If you disable Neo4j-Migrations via `quarkus.neo4j.migrations.enabled` we won't apply Migrations at startup but the `Migrations` object
will still be in the context to be used.

TIP: All other propertiers available for the <<usage_spring-boot_all-properties,Spring-Boot-Starter>> are available for the Quarkus-Module, too.
Their namespace is `quarkus.neo4j.migrations` instead of `org.neo4j.migrations`.


[[usage_maven-plugin]]
== Maven-Plugin

You can trigger Neo4j-Migrations from your build a Maven-Plugin.
Please refer to the dedicated link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/plugin-info.html[Maven-Plugin page] for
a detailed list of all goals and configuration option as well as the default lifecycle mapping of the plugin.

=== Configuration

Most of the time you will configure the following properties for the plugin:

.Configuring the Maven-Plugin
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <configuration>
                <user>neo4j</user>
                <password>secret</password>
                <address>bolt://localhost:${it-database-port}</address>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

All goals provide those properties.
By default, the plugin will look in `neo4j/migrations` for <<concepts_migrations_cypher-based, Cypher-based migrations>>.
You can change that via `locationsToScan` inside the `configuration` element like this:

.Changing the locations to scan for the Maven-Plugin
[source,xml]
----
<locationsToScan>
    <locationToScan>file://${project.build.outputDirectory}/custom/path</locationToScan>
</locationsToScan>
----

Add multiple `locationToScan` elements for multiple locations to scan.

=== Goals

All goals as described in <<usage_common>> are supported.

* link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/clean-mojo.html[clean], see <<usage_common_clean>>
* link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/help-mojo.html[help]
* link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/info-mojo.html[info], see <<usage_common_info>>
* link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/migrate-mojo.html[migrate], see <<usage_common_migrate>>
* link:{siteBaseUrl}/neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin/validate-mojo.html[clean], see <<usage_common_validate>>
