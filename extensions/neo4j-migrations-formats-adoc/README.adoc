WARNING: This is an extension to the main project and independent of it.
         As of publishing and writing the first version (1.8.0), it is considered
         experimental.

== What does it do?

When added to one of the supported use-case scenarios as an external library, it allows  Neo4j-Migrations to discover
AsciiDoctor files and use them as sources of Cypher statements for defining refactorings.

An AsciiDoctor based migration can have zero to many code blocks of type `cypher` with an id matching our versioning scheme
and valid inline Cypher content. The block definition looks like this:

[source,asciidoc]
....
[source,cypher,id=V1.0__Create_initial_data]
----
// Your Cypher based migration
----
....

In fact, this `README.adoc` is a source of migrations on its own. It contains the following refactorings:

[source,cypher,id=V1.0__Create_initial_data]
----
CREATE (a:Author {
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: 'Stephen King'
})
CREATE (b:Book {
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: 'The Dark Tower'
})
CREATE (a)-[:WROTE]->(b)
----

We can have as many migrations as we want.

[source,cypher,id=V1.1__Add_more_data]
----
MATCH (a:Author {
  name: 'Stephen King'
})
CREATE (b:Book  {
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: 'Atlantis'
})
CREATE (a)-[:WROTE]->(b);


CREATE (a:Author {
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: 'Grace Blakeley'
})
CREATE (b:Book {
  id: randomUUID(),
  name: 'Stolen: How to Save the World From Financialisation'
})
CREATE (a)-[:WROTE]->(b);
----

And to make queries on peoples name perform fast, we should add some indexes and constraints.
This we do with a separate document, `V1.2__Create_id_constraints.xml` to be included here:

[source,xml,id=V1.2__Create_id_constraints,indent=0,tabsize=2]
----
include::src/test/resources/neo4j/migrations-with-includes/V1.2__Create_id_constraints.xml[]
----

WARNING: Includes are *not* processed. To make the system process the above xml content respectively any included Cypher
         file, these files must live in a configured location, as described in the manual.
         +
         We opted against resolving includes for two reasons: It's easier to reason about the sources of migrations when just
         inline code is processed and also, inclusion of arbitrary URLs may expose a security risk.
         +
         Please have a look at the source of *this* file itself to understand what works and what not.

The following block is an example of an included Cypher file, that will be used from its own location when this changeset is applied,
but can still be referenced in this documentation:

[source,cypher,id=V2.0__Add_likes]
----
include::src/test/resources/neo4j/migrations-with-includes/V2.0__Add_likes.cypher[]
----

The checksum of AsciiDoctor based migrations is computed individually per Cypher block, not for the whole file. So one
AsciiDoctor file basically behaves as a container for many migrations.

== How to use it?

The extension is loaded via service loader. In a standard Spring Boot or Quarkus application you just need to add one additional
dependency:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.AsciiDoctor extension as Maven dependency
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{artifactIdFormatAdoc}</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Or in case you fancy Gradle:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.AsciiDoctor extension as Gradle dependency
----
dependencies {
    implementation '{groupId}:{artifactIdFormatAdoc}:{latest_version}'
}
----

And that's all.

For the CLI, you should download the `-all` artifact from Maven Central: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/eu/michael-simons/neo4j/neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc-{latest_version}-all.jar[neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc-{latest_version}-all.jar]
This will work only with the JVM based CLI version, which is available https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip[here].

A full example looks like this:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
curl -LO https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
curl -LO https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/eu/michael-simons/neo4j/neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc-{latest_version}-all.jar
unzip neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}
CLASSPATH_PREFIX=../neo4j-migrations-formats-adoc-{latest_version}-all.jar \
  bin/neo4j-migrations --password secret \
  --location file:///path/to/neo4j/adoc-migrations \
  info
----

Which will result in:

[source,console]
----
neo4j@localhost:7687 (Neo4j/4.4.4)
