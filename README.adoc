== Introduction

// tag::introduction[]
Neo4j-Migrations are a set of tools to make your schema migrations as easy as possible.
They provide a uniform way for applications, the command line and build tools alike to track, manage and apply changes to your database, in short: to refactor your database.
The project is inspired to a large extend by https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB], which is an awesome tool for migration of relational databases.
Most things evolve around Cypher scripts, however the Core API of Neo4j-Migrations allows defining Java classes as migrations as well.

Neo4j-Migrations builds directly on top of the official https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java driver], supports Neo4j from 3.5 up to 4.4, including enterprise features such as multidatabase support and impersonation.
The only dependencies are said driver and https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[ClassGraph], the latter being used to find migrations on the classpath.

The history of migrations applied is stored as a subgraph in your database.

== Downloads

Binary downloads for the CLI are available on our https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases[release page]
for each version. Maven artifacts are available on https://search.maven.org/artifact/eu.michael-simons.neo4j/neo4j-migrations[central] under
the following coordinates:

* Core API: `{groupId}:{artifactIdCore}:{latest_version}`
* Spring-Boot-Starter: `{groupId}:{artifactIdSpringBoot}:{latest_version}`
* Maven-Plugin: `{groupId}:{artifactIdMavenPlugin}:{latest_version}`

== Compatibility

Neo4j-Migrations can be used against Neo4j 3.5 and all Neo4j 4.x versions upto 4.4, including Neo4j-Aura.

// tag::compatibility[]
The Core API and the JVM based version of the CLI module of Neo4j-Migrations requires at least Java 8 to run.
Native binaries are provided for 64bit versions of macOS, Linux and Windows. The native binaries don't require a JVM to be installed.

All releases of Neo4j-Migrations are compiled with JDK 17 while targeting JDK 8. Thus, we ensure both source, target and API compatibility with JDK 8.
In addition, the Core API is provided as a Multi-Release-Jar, providing a `module-info.java` for JDK 11 and higher, making it a good citizen on the Java module path.

For JDK 17 and higher we do restrict the usage of some interfaces and have better boundaries for you what you can safely implement and what you should not.
