== Introduction

// tag::introduction[]
Neo4j-Migrations are a set of tools to make your schema migrations as easy as possible.
They provide a uniform way for applications, the command line and build tools alike to track, manage and apply changes to your database, in short: to refactor your database.
The project is inspired to a large extend by https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB], which is an awesome tool for migration of relational databases.
Most things evolve around Cypher-Scripts, however the core API of Neo4j-Migrations allows defining Java classes as migrations as well.

Neo4j-Migrations builds directly on top of the official https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java driver] , supports Neo4j from 3.5 up to 4.4, including enterprise features such as multidatabase support and impersonation.
The only dependencies are said driver and https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[ClassGraph], the later being used to find migrations on the classpath.

The history of migrations applied are stored as a subgraph in your database.
