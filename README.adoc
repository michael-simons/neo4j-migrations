This is a tool for defining Java based migrations that should be applied and recorded against a Neo4j instance.
The only dependencies are the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java driver] and https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[ClassGraph], the later being used to find migrations on the classpath.

Neo4j Migrations is inspired by https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB], which is an awesome tool for migration of relational databases.

== Usage

=== As standalone CLI

Since 0.0.5, you can grab binaries of `neo4j-migrations` CLI version at Maven central:
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/eu/michael-simons/neo4j/neo4j-migrations/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip[neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip]

Unzip them (`unzip neo4j-migrations-cli-{latest_version}.zip`), go the the director (`cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}`) and execute the program
(`neo4j-migrations` on Unix-like operating systems and `neo4j-migrations.cmd` on Windows):

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./neo4j-migrations -h
Usage: neo4j-migrations [-hvV] -p[=<password>] [-p[=<password>]]...
                        [-a=<address>] [-d=<database>]
                        [--transaction-mode=<transactionMode>] [-u=<user>]
                        [--location=<locationsToScan>]...
                        [--package=<packagesToScan>]... [COMMAND]
Migrates Neo4j databases.
  -a, --address=<address>   The address this migration should connect to. The
                              driver supports bolt, bolt+routing or neo4j as
                              schemes.
  -d, --database=<database> The database to migration (Neo4j 4.0+).
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
      --location=<locationsToScan>
                            Location to scan. Repeat for multiple locations.
  -p, --password[=<password>]
                            The password of the user connecting to the database.
      --package=<packagesToScan>
                            Package to scan. Repeat for multiple packages.
      --transaction-mode=<transactionMode>
                            The transaction mode to use.
  -u, --username=<user>     The login of the user connecting to the database.
  -v                        Log the configuration and a couple of other things.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  info     Retrieves all applied and pending informations, prints them and
             exits.
  migrate  Retrieves all pending migrations, verify and applies them.

Here's an example that looks for migrations in a Java package and it's subpackages and in a filesystem location for Cypher based migrations.
It uses the `info` command to tell you which migrations have been applied and which not:

You can repeat both `--package`  and `--location` parameter for fine grained control.
Use `migrate` to apply migrations:

----
./neo4j-migrations -uneo4j -psecret --package some.migrations.changeset1 --package some.migrations.changeset2 migrate
Applied migration 001 ("FirstMigration")
Applied migration 002 ("AnotherMigration")
Applied migration 023 ("NichtsIstWieEsScheint")
Database migrated to version 023.

If we go back to the `info` example above and grab all migrations again, we find the following result:

Another `migrate` - this time with all packages - gives us the following output and result:

----

=== From your build tool

==== Maven Plugin

You can trigger Neo4j Migrations from your build via plugin:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>migrate</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>migrate</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <user>neo4j</user>
                <password>secret</password>
                <address>bolt://localhost:${it-database-port}</address>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

By default, the plugin will look in `neo4j/migrations` resource.
You can change that via `locationsToScan`:

[source,xml]
----
<locationsToScan>
    <locationToScan>file://${project.build.outputDirectory}/custom/path/to/migrate</locationToScan>
</locationsToScan>
----

Add multiple elements for multiple locations.
The plugin has the same parameters as the standalone or CLI version.

=== Inside your application

==== In a Spring Boot application

We provide a starter with automatic configuration for Spring Boot.
Declare the following dependency in your Spring Boot application:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

That starter itself depends on the starter for the Neo4j Java Driver:
https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver-spring-boot-starter[neo4j-java-driver-spring-boot-starter]
and thus you have auto configuration for your connection and the migrations.

Neo4j Migrations will automatically look for migrations in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` and will fail if this location does not exists.
It does not scan by default for Java based migrations.

Here's an example on how to configure the driver and the migrations:

[source,properties]
----
org.neo4j.driver.authentication.username=neo4j
org.neo4j.driver.authentication.password=secret
org.neo4j.driver.uri=bolt://localhost:7687

# Add configuration for your migrations, for example, additional packages to scan
org.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan=your.changesets, another.changeset

# Or disable the check if the location exists
org.neo4j.migrations.check-location=false
----

The following configuration properties are supported:

[cols=4*,options=header]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Default
|Description

| `org.neo4j.migrations.check-location`
| java.lang.Boolean
| true
| Whether to check that migration scripts location exists.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.database`
| java.lang.String
| `null`
| The database that should be migrated (Neo4j 4.0+ only). Leave {@literal null} for using the default database.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.enabled`
| java.lang.Boolean
| true
| Whether to enable Neo4j migrations or not.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.encoding`
| java.nio.charset.Charset
| UTF-8
| Encoding of Cypher migrations.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.installed-by`
| java.lang.String
| System user
| Username recorded as property {@literal by} on the MIGRATED_TO relationship.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.locations-to-scan`
| java.lang.String[]
| `classpath:neo4j/migrations`
| Locations of migrations scripts.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan`
| java.lang.String[]
| An empty array
| List of packages to scan for Java migrations.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.transaction-mode`
| TransactionMode
| `PER_MIGRATION`
| The transaction mode in use (Defaults to "per migration", meaning one script is run in one transaction).
|===

NOTE: Migrations can be disabled by setting `org.neo4j.migrations.enabled` to `false`.


==== Other applications

Declare the extension as Maven dependency:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Put your migrations as Java classes into your project:

[source,java]
----
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration;
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationContext;

import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.Session;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        try (Session session = context.getSession()) { // <1>
            // Steps necessary for a migration
        }
    }
}
----
<.> It is important that you use the supplied session (or the `SessionConfig` if you want to use another type of `Session`)
    for your session retrieval, otherwise you may  run that migration in a different database than in which the tool itself
    is run. However, you are free in which database you run this. Your mileage may vary.

The class names must start with a `V` followed by digits followed by `__` and than some valid Java class name.

To use them create a `Migrations` instance to scan your project and apply all found migrations:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations = new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder().withPackagesToScan("org.company.changeset1").build(),
    GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"))
);

migrations.apply();
----

You're migrations will be recorded as a chain of applied migrations (as nodes with the label `__Neo4jMigration`). They can use the driver any way they like.

There's no rollback yet. If any migration fails, the chain will stop, but will not rollback previous migrations.

=== Cypher script based migrations

You can put Cypher scripts ending with `.cypher` inside your classpath resources under `neo4j/migrations`.
From there on they'll be picked up automatically.

Here's an example:

[source,cypher]
.neo4j/migrations/V007__BondTheNameIsBond.cypher
----
CREATE (agent:`007`) RETURN agent;
UNWIND RANGE(1,6) AS i
WITH i CREATE (n:OtherAgents {idx: '00' + i})
RETURN n
;
----

Scripts can contain multiple statements, separated by a `;` followed by a newline.
Statements will be executed in one transaction by default.
That behaviour can be changed as follows:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations= new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder()
        .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_STATEMENT)
        .build(),
    driver
);
migrations.apply();
----

If you want Migrations to look at other places, configure it as follows:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations = new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder()
        .withLocationsToScan(
            "classpath:my/awesome/migrations",
            "file:/path/to/migration"
        ).build(),
    GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"))
);

migrations.apply();
----

== For the adventurous

The Neo4j Java driver and this application supports native compilation with GraalVM so that you can create a native executable.
Read more about it https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[here].

After installing at least GraalVM 20.1.0, prepare your environment as follows:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-20.1.0/Contents/Home
export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME
----

The paths are probably different on your system.

The `neo4j-migrations-cli` module has a build profile `create-native-image` that you use to create a binary for your OS.
Run it with:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./mvnw -Pcreate-native-image clean package
----

The resulting migration tool can only be used to load Cypher script based migrations in file locations.
It won't find classes, as those are instantiated dynamically via reflection, which is not supported in full in a native image.
