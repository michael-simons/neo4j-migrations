/**
 * Annotation to mark one or more fields of a class as unique properties for a given node or relationship.  You will want
 * to use it on a type for building composite constraints (constraints spanning more than one field) and on single fields
 * for single property constraints.
 * <p>
 * When is this annotation useful?
 * <ul>
 *     <li>You have a plain Java application with some models but no object mapper on the classpath but you still want
 *     to derive content</li>
 *     <li>You are a Spring Data Neo4j (SDN6+) user and want to enrich your models with unique or existential constraints</li>
 *     <li>You are an Neo4j-OGM user but are looking for an object mapper agnostic way of enriching your model </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * <i>Determining labels or types:</i> Depending on your approach and combination with other annotations (such as SDN6+ or
 * OGM annotations), the process is as following
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Explicitly use {@link #label()}</li>
 *     <li>On a plain class: The simple class name is used as label (we default to targeting nodes)</li>
 *     <li>If combined any of the following SDN6+ annotations {@code org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Node} or
 *     {@code org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.RelationshipProperties}, we default to the SDN6 approach</li>
 *     <li>If combined with an Neo4j-OGM annotation, we default to the Neo4j-OGM approach</li>
 * </ul>
 * <i>Note:</i> We follow the above algorithm strictly, and we don't try to resolve conflicts. If in doubt, the processor
 * will fail hard
 * <p>
 * Unique constraints are only supported for Nodes / Labels, not for Relationships / Types.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be repeated on a class. If you decide to put contradicting information on a class, for example
 * targeting labels with one annotation and relationships with another, we won't stop you as long as we can resolve
 * both error free: You might end up with a catalog that defines several constraints coming from one type and aiming for
 * both nodes and relationship constraints.
