This is a tool for defining Java based migrations that should be applied and recorded against a Neo4j instance.
The only dependencies are the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java driver] and https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[ClassGraph], the later being used to find migrations on the classpath.

Neo4j Migrations is inspired by https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB], which is an awesome tool for migration of relational databases.

== Usage

A script based migration must have a name following the given pattern to be recognized:

```
V1_2_3__Add_last_name_index.cypher
```

* Prefix `V` for "__V__ersioned Migrations"
* Version with optional underscores separating as many parts as you like
* Separator: `__` (two underscores)
* Description: Underscores or spaces separate the wo
* Suffix: `.cypher`

This applies to Cypher scripts for the CLI as well as resources.

=== As standalone CLI

NOTE: Since *0.3.1* binaries that require a JVM as well as native binaries for Unix, macOS and Windows are available on each https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases[release]. Get the latest here: https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip[neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip]
      +
      Only the JVM version does support custom, Java based migrations as shown in the following examples (argument `--package`), the natively compiled version does not.
      If you want to use the `--package` option, you must export the path to your classes as `$CLASSPATH_PREFIX` (See below) or
      add them as packaged up as Jar files to the `lib` folder of the distribution.

Older binaries of the CLI are on 
https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/eu/michael-simons/neo4j/neo4j-migrations-cli/[Maven Central]

Unzip them (`unzip neo4j-migrations-cli-{latest_version}.zip`), go the directory (`cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}`) and execute the program
(`bin/neo4j-migrations` on Unix-like operating systems and `bin/neo4j-migrations.bat` on Windows):

TIP: On macOS you can use Homebrew to install neo4j-migrations via:
     +
     `brew install michael-simons/homebrew-neo4j-migrations/neo4j-migrations`
     +
     Afterwards, the `neo4j-migrations` command will be available on your path.

                        [--package=<packagesToScan>]... [COMMAND]
Migrates Neo4j databases.
  -a, --address=<address>   The address this migration should connect to. The
                              driver supports bolt, bolt+routing or neo4j as
                              schemes.
      --autocrlf            Automatically convert Windows line-endings (CRLF)
                              to LF when reading resource based migrations,
                              pretty much what the same Git option does during
                              checkin.
  -d, --database=<database> The database that should be migrated (Neo4j EE  4.0
                              +).
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
      --impersonate=<impersonatedUser>
                            The name of a user to impersonate during migration
                              (Neo4j EE  4.4+).
      --location=<locationsToScan>
                            Location to scan. Repeat for multiple locations.
  -p, --password[=<password>]
                            The password of the user connecting to the database.
      --package=<packagesToScan>
                            Package to scan. Repeat for multiple packages.
      --schema-database=<schemaDatabase>
                            The database that should be used for storing
                              informations about migrations (Neo4j EE 4.0+).
      --transaction-mode=<transactionMode>
                            The transaction mode to use.
  -u, --username=<user>     The login of the user connecting to the database.
  -v                        Log the configuration and a couple of other things.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
      --validate-on-migrate Validating helps you verify that the migrations
                              applied to the database match the ones available
                              locally and is on by default.
Commands:
  info     Retrieves all applied and pending informations, prints them and
             exits.
  migrate  Retrieves all pending migrations, verify and applies them.

Here's an example that looks for migrations in a Java package and it's subpackages and in a filesystem location for Cypher based migrations.
It uses the `info` command to tell you which migrations have been applied and which not:

You can repeat both `--package`  and `--location` parameter for fine grained control.
Use `migrate` to apply migrations:

./bin/neo4j-migrations -uneo4j -psecret --package some.migrations.changeset1 --package some.migrations.changeset2 migrate
Applied migration 001 ("FirstMigration")

Database migrated to version 023.

==== A template for Java based migrations

As stated above, this will work only with the JVM distribution. Follow those steps:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
wget https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases/download/{latest_version}/neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
unzip neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}.zip
cd neo4j-migrations-{latest_version}
mkdir -p my-migrations/some/migrations
cat <<EOT >> my-migrations/some/migrations/V001__MyFirstMigration.java
package some.migrations;

import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.JavaBasedMigration;
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.core.MigrationContext;

import org.neo4j.driver.Driver;
import org.neo4j.driver.Session;

public class V001__MyFirstMigration implements JavaBasedMigration {

    @Override
    public void apply(MigrationContext context) {
        try (Session session = context.getSession()) {
        }
    }
}
EOT
javac -cp "lib/*" my-migrations/some/migrations/*
CLASSPATH_PREFIX=my-migrations ./bin/neo4j-migrations -v -uneo4j -psecret --package some.migrations info
----

=== From your build tool

==== Maven Plugin

You can trigger Neo4j Migrations from your build via plugin:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>migrate</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>migrate</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <user>neo4j</user>
                <password>secret</password>
                <address>bolt://localhost:${it-database-port}</address>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

By default, the plugin will look in `neo4j/migrations` resource.
You can change that via `locationsToScan`:

[source,xml]
----
<locationsToScan>
    <locationToScan>file://${project.build.outputDirectory}/custom/path/to/migrate</locationToScan>
</locationsToScan>
----

Add multiple elements for multiple locations.
The plugin has the same parameters as the standalone or CLI version.

=== Inside your application

==== In a Spring Boot application

We provide a starter with automatic configuration for Spring Boot.
Declare the following dependency in your Spring Boot application:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.michael-simons.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-migrations-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
</dependency>
----

That starter itself depends on the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver].
The driver is managed by Spring Boot since 2.4 and you can enjoy configuration support directly through Spring Boot.
For Boot versions prior to Spring Boot 2.4, please have a look at version https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/tree/0.0.13[0.0.13] of this library.

Neo4j Migrations will automatically look for migrations in `classpath:neo4j/migrations` and will fail if this location does not exists.
It does not scan by default for Java based migrations.

Here's an example on how to configure the driver and the migrations:

[source,properties]
----
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=secret
spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687

# Add configuration for your migrations, for example, additional packages to scan
org.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan=your.changesets, another.changeset

# Or disable the check if the location exists
org.neo4j.migrations.check-location=false
----

The following configuration properties are supported:

[cols="40a,5m,5m,50a",options=header]
|===
|Name
|Type
|Default
|Description

| `org.neo4j.migrations.check-location`
| java.lang.Boolean
| true
| Whether to check that migration scripts location exists.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.database`
| java.lang.String
| null
| The database that should be migrated (Neo4j EE 4.0+ only). Leave {@literal null} for using the default database.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.schema-database`
| java.lang.String
| null
| The database that should be used for storing informations about migrations (Neo4j EE 4.0+ only). Leave {@literal null} for using the default database.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.impersonated-user`
| java.lang.String
| null
| An alternative user to impersonate during migration. Might have higher privileges than the user connected, which  will be dropped again after migration. Requires Neo4j EE 4.4+. Leave {@literal null} for using the connected user.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.enabled`
| java.lang.Boolean
| true
| Whether to enable Neo4j migrations or not.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.encoding`
| java.nio.charset.Charset
| UTF-8
| Encoding of Cypher migrations.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.installed-by`
| java.lang.String
| System user
| Username recorded as property {@literal by} on the MIGRATED_TO relationship.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.locations-to-scan`
| java.lang.String[]
| `classpath:neo4j/migrations`
| Locations of migrations scripts.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.packages-to-scan`
| java.lang.String[]
| An empty array
| List of packages to scan for Java migrations.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.transaction-mode`
| TransactionMode
| `PER_MIGRATION`
| The transaction mode in use (Defaults to "per migration", meaning one script is run in one transaction).

| `org.neo4j.migrations.validate-on-migrate`
| boolean
| `true`
| Validating helps you verify that the migrations applied to the database match the ones available locally and is on by default.

| `org.neo4j.migrations.autocrlf`
| boolean
| `false`
| Automatically convert Windows line-endings (CRLF) to LF when reading resource based migrations, pretty much what the same Git option does during checkin.
|===

NOTE: Migrations can be disabled by setting `org.neo4j.migrations.enabled` to `false`.

If you want to use your migrations together with `@DataNeo4jTest` which is provided with Spring Boot out of the box,
you have to manually import our autoconfiguration like this:

[source,java,indent=0,tabsize=4]
----
import ac.simons.neo4j.migrations.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.MigrationsAutoConfiguration;

		registry.add("spring.neo4j.uri", neo4j::getBoltUrl);
		registry.add("spring.neo4j.authentication.username", () -> "neo4j");
		registry.add("spring.neo4j.authentication.password", neo4j::getAdminPassword);
	}

	@Test
	void yourTest(@Autowired Driver driver) {
		// Whatever is tested
    }
}
----
<.> Use the dedicated Neo4j test slice
<.> Import _this_ auto configuration (which is not part of Spring Boot)
<.> Bring up a container to test against
<.> Use `DynamicPropertySource`  for configuring the test resources dynamically

==== Other applications

        }
    }
}
----
<.> It is important that you use the supplied session (or the `SessionConfig` if you want to use another type of `Session`)
    for your session retrieval, otherwise you may  run that migration in a different database than in which the tool itself
    is run. However, you are free in which database you run this. Your mileage may vary.

The class names must start with a `V` followed by digits followed by `__` and than some valid Java class name.

To use them create a `Migrations` instance to scan your project and apply all found migrations:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations = new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder().withPackagesToScan("some.migrations").build(),
    GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"))
);

migrations.apply();
----

Your migrations will be recorded as a chain of applied migrations (as nodes with the label `__Neo4jMigration`). They can use the driver any way they like.

There's no rollback yet. If any migration fails, the chain will stop, but will not rollback previous migrations.

=== Cypher script based migrations

You can put Cypher scripts ending with `.cypher` inside your classpath resources under `neo4j/migrations`.
From there on they'll be picked up automatically.

Here's an example:

[source,cypher]
.neo4j/migrations/V007__BondTheNameIsBond.cypher
----
CREATE (agent:`007`) RETURN agent;
UNWIND RANGE(1,6) AS i
WITH i CREATE (n:OtherAgents {idx: '00' + i})
RETURN n
;
----

Scripts can contain multiple statements, separated by a `;` followed by a newline.
Statements will be executed in one transaction by default.
That behaviour can be changed as follows:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations= new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder()
        .withTransactionMode(MigrationsConfig.TransactionMode.PER_STATEMENT)
        .build(),
    driver
);
migrations.apply();
----

If you want Migrations to look at other places, configure it as follows:

[source,java]
----
Migrations migrations = new Migrations(
    MigrationsConfig.builder()
        .withLocationsToScan(
            "classpath:my/awesome/migrations",
            "file:/path/to/migration"
        ).build(),
    GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", AuthTokens.basic("neo4j", "secret"))
);

migrations.apply();
----

== Separate schema databases

Since version 1.1.0 you can use a different database for storing information about migrations.
You need to run against Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
The command line argument respectively the property is `schema-database` throughout the configuration.
The name given must be a valid Neo4j database name (See https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/manage-databases/configuration/[Administration and configuration]).
The database must exist and the user must have write access to it.

Valid scenarios are:

- Using a schema database for one other database
- Using a schema database for maintaining multiple migrations of different databases
- Using pairs of schema databases and target databases

Neo4j migrations will create subgraphs in the schema database identifiable by a `migrationTarget`-property in the `__Neo4jMigration`-nodes.
Neo4j migrations will *not* record a `migrationTarget` for the default database (usually `neo4j`), so that this feature
doesn't break compatibility with schemas created before 1.1.0.

== For the adventurous

NOTE: Native binaries for Windows, Unix and macOS are supplied since 0.3.1 at https://github.com/michael-simons/neo4j-migrations/releases[the releases page].

WARNING: The natively compiled version does not support Java based migrations and will fail if you try to point it to any package to scan.

The Neo4j Java driver and this application supports native compilation with GraalVM so that you can create a native executable.
Read more about it https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/[here].

After installing at least GraalVM 21.3.0, prepare your environment as follows:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
export GRAALVM_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java17-21.3.0/Contents/Home
export JAVA_HOME=$GRAALVM_HOME
----

The paths are probably different on your system.

The `neo4j-migrations-cli` module has a build profile `create-native-image` that you use to create a binary for your OS.
Run it with:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./mvnw -Pnative clean package
----

The resulting migration tool can only be used to load Cypher script based migrations in file locations.
It won't find classes, as those are instantiated dynamically via reflection, which is not supported in full in a native image.
